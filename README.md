# Telegram Bot -- powered by OpenAI GPT

## üîó About this project
Late November 2022, Sam Altman and Elon Musk created an AI that aims to develop and direct artificial intelligence. This Telegram bot is based on OpenAI GPT.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è How to setup?
Just use replit, not using herokuüòÖüòÖ

Before starting..
- Create a bot at @BotFather, and get the TOKEN.
- Create OpenAI GPT Account, and get the API Key.
- Create a [Replit](https://replit.com) Account.

### üöÄ Using Replit
1. [Duplicate this repository to Replit](https://replit.com/github/galihpujiirianto/telegram-openai), then wait for it to finish.
2. Go to Secrets, then enter:
   - `TOKEN`: Telegram bot token
   - `OPENAI_APIKEY`: OpenAI API Key
3. Start repl, login in webview then copy the URL.
4. Open a browser, then type `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<replit webview url>`. Notes:
   - Replace `<TOKEN`> with Telegram bot token,
   - Replace `<replit webview url>` with replit webview url that has been copied.
   - Example: `https://api.telegram.org/bot1899879708:AAFMLxLfenIsLvXd1vzRSMQ0fk_kqBm_WWA/setWebhook?url=https://openainihh.galihpuji.repl.co`
